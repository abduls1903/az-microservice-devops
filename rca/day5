Root Cause: DockerHub access token used in Jenkins lacked required write scope.
Impact: Image push failed despite successful authentication.
Fix: Regenerated DockerHub token with Read/Write/Delete permissions and updated Jenkins credentials.
Prevention: Always verify token scopes before CI integration.
