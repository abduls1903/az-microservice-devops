Issue: Jenkins pipeline failed during SCM checkout and build stages
Root Cause:
1. Multiple SCM checkouts caused workspace mismatch
2. Incorrect build tools (Maven used for Node app)
3. Missing runtime dependencies on Jenkins host
Fix:
1. Disabled default checkout and controlled SCM manually
2. Used Docker agent for Node.js build
Ran Docker build on Jenkins host
Prevention:
Always control checkout explicity in Declarative pipelines ans isolate build environments using Docker agents
