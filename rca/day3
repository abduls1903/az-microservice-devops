Issue: Deployment failed due to missing Docker image tag.
Impact: Service could not be started as image pull failed.
Root Cause: incorrect image tag was referenced after deleting a Docker Hub image.
Detection: docker pull returned image not found error.
Resoulution: Rolled back to last stable image version (v1).
Prevention: Enforce immutable tags and restrict manual deletion of production image versions.
