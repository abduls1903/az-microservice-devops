Issue: Application outage after Helm upgrade.
Impact: Service became unavailable due to failed pod startups.
Root Cause: Invalid Docker image tag and incorrect service port introduced during Helm values update.
Detection: Helm status showed failed releases and pods entered ImagePullBackOff.
Resolution: Rolled back Helm release to last stable revision.
Prevention: validate image tags before Helm upgrades and use pre-deployment checks or canary releases.
