Root Cause:
Kubernetes deployment referenced the Docker image tag 'latest', but jenkins CI pipeline only pushed images with build-number tags. The 'latest' tag didnot exist in Docker Hub.
Impact:
Kubernetes failed to pull the container image, causing pods to remain in 'ImagePullBackOff' state and the application to be inaccessible.
Fix:
Aligned image tagging between Jenkins and Kubernetes by either pushing the 'latest' tag from CI or updating the deployment to use the exact build-number image tag.
Prevention:
Ensure consistent image tagging strategy across CI/CD pipelines and verify image availability in the container registery before deploying to Kubernetes.
