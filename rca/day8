Inicdent-1: CrashLoopBackOff
Isssue: Pods entered CrashLoopBackOff after Helm upgrade
Impact: Application unavailable
Detection: kubectl get pods showed repeated restarts
Root Cause: Container port mismatch (5000 configured, app runs on 3000)
Resolution: Corrected port in values.yaml and upgraded release
Prevention: Validate container port before deployment, add readiness probe

Incident-2: ImagePullBackOff
Issue: Pods failed to start with ImagePullBackOff
Impact: Service downtime
Detection: kubectl describe pod showed manifest unknown
Root Cause: Invalid Docker image tag build-tag instead of v1 in values.yaml
Resolution: Corrected tag and redeployed
Prevention: Implement image tag validation in CI pipeline
